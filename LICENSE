## Restriction on Use for Offensive Security Purposes and Prohibition of Facilitation and Encouragement of License Violations:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, the Rules shall not be used for offensive security purposes, including but not limited to, testing, developing, configuring, or modifying malicious software, implants, or mechanisms intended for unauthorized access, evasion of security measures, or harm to individuals, data, or computing resources. For the purposes of this License, "offensive security purposes" refers to activities aimed at exploiting, bypassing, or undermining the security mechanisms of software, networks, or systems without explicit authorization and for purposes other than enhancing the security posture of such software, networks, or systems.

Additionally, it is expressly prohibited to facilitate, promote, or encourage the use of the Rules in any manner that violates the terms of this License, including but not limited to, the inclusion of the Rules or mechanisms for obtaining the Rules (such as hyperlinks, repositories, or code snippets) in software, tools, frameworks, or services that enable or encourage the use of the Rules for offensive security purposes. This prohibition applies regardless of whether such facilitation requires an action (e.g., uncommenting a line of code, downloading from a specified source) by the end-user.

Distributors, developers, and users must not provide instructions, guidance, or recommendations to circumvent or otherwise violate the restrictions of this License. Any indirect support or facilitation of obtaining, configuring, or using the Rules in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License is considered a breach of the License terms.

Violation of these provisions constitutes a breach of this License and may result in immediate termination of the rights granted herein. Furthermore, the Licensee acknowledges that such use or facilitation may expose them to legal liability and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the authors and copyright holders of the Rules from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from such prohibited use or facilitation.
